# InverseKinematicsGUI

This is part of the project to build an open source desktop GUI software for the simulation and control of 6 degrees of freedom Stewart Platforms.

## What does this code do?

The code is used to test inverse kinematics simulation of a stewart platform design. The goal is to output servo motor outputs based on certain initial conditions.
